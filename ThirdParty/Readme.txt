Run CallingCmake_opencv.cmd at first.
And then run CallingCmake_dlib.cmd.

In some dlib_examples_build_x86_mkl projects, you need to set "Use Intel MKL" to "Parallel" in project property screen.
 * If you use "Debug" configuration and you don't set it, building the programs failes.


[NOTE]
../../opencv_{x86|x64}/install is set to OpenCV_DIR:PATH in dlib cmake settings.
I set BUILD_opencv_world=OFF, because OpenCV_LIBS (=OpenCV_LIB_COMPONENTS) contains both of each libary and opencv_world, so link errors occurs.
