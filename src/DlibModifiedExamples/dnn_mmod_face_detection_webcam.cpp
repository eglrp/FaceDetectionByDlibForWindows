	This example shows how to run a CNN based face detector using dlib.  The
	example loads a pretrained model and uses it to find faces in images.  The
	CNN model is much more accurate than the HOG based model shown in the
	face_detection_ex.cpp example, but takes much more computational power to
	run, and is meant to be executed on a GPU to attain reasonable speed.  For
	example, on a NVIDIA Titan X GPU, this example program processes images at
	about the same speed as face_detection_ex.cpp.

	Also, users who are just learning about dlib's deep learning API should read
	the dnn_introduction_ex.cpp and dnn_introduction2_ex.cpp examples to learn
	how the API works.  For an introduction to the object detection method you
	should read dnn_mmod_ex.cpp



	TRAINING THE MODEL
		Finally, users interested in how the face detector was trained should
		read the dnn_mmod_ex.cpp example program.  It should be noted that the
		face detector used in this example uses a bigger training dataset and
		larger CNN architecture than what is shown in dnn_mmod_ex.cpp, but
		otherwise training is the same.  If you compare the net_type statements
		in this file and dnn_mmod_ex.cpp you will see that they are very similar
		except that the number of parameters has been increased.

		Additionally, the following training parameters were different during
		training: The following lines in dnn_mmod_ex.cpp were changed from
			mmod_options options(face_boxes_train, 40*40);
			trainer.set_iterations_without_progress_threshold(300);
		to the following when training the model used in this example:
			mmod_options options(face_boxes_train, 80*80);
			trainer.set_iterations_without_progress_threshold(8000);

		Also, the random_cropper was left at its default settings,  So we didn't
		call these functions:
			cropper.set_chip_dims(200, 200);
			cropper.set_min_object_height(0.2);

		The training data used to create the model is also available at
		http://dlib.net/files/data/dlib_face_detection_dataset-2016-09-30.tar.gz
